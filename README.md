 # Moon Quest
    #### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/sZMv8So7Xjc
    #### Description:
    A game like "Flappy Bird", you are an astronaut trying to explore around the moon, but you have
    to be careful, because therre are moon rocks everywhere and you have to avoid them and get the best
    score you can. Using Pygame as main source for this game, I created two more classes: Character and Walls.
    The main events occur in the project file where all the update and gameloop is happening with also the way pictures
    are displayed, counting the score and derect collisions.
